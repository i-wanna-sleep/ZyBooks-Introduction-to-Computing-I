PROMPT: Compute the acceleration of gravity for a given distance from the earth's center, distCenter, assigning the result to accelGravity. 
The expression for the acceleration of gravity is: (G * M) / (d2), where G is the gravitational constant 6.673 x 10-11, M is the mass of the earth 5.98 x 1024 (in kg) and d is the distance in meters from the earth's center (stored in variable distCenter). 

import java.util.Scanner;
public class GravityCalculation {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
      Scanner scnr = new Scanner(System.in);
      double G = 6.673e-11;
      double M = 5.98e24;
      double accelGravity;
      double distCenter;

      distCenter = scnr.nextDouble();

      /* Your solution goes here  */
      accelGravity = (G * M) / (distCenter * distCenter);
      
      //END OF SOLUTION 

      System.out.println(accelGravity);
   }
}
